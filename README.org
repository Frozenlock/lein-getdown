A Leiningen plugin to use the Getdown java utility. Enables
auto-update (for the user) of your Clojure application!

See the [[https://code.google.com/p/getdown/][Getdown documentation on google code]].

** Usage

User-level plugins:

Put =[lein-getdown "0.0.1"]= into the =:plugins= vector of your
=:user= profile.

Project-level plugins:

Put =[lein-getdown "0.0.1"]= into the =:plugins= vector of your
project.clj.


You will also have to add a =:getdown= map with your own Getdown
configurations. *You must at least have the :appbase address*.

: :getdown {:appbase "https://bacnethelp.com/getdown/logger/"
:           :allow-offline true
:           :resource ["wontbeunpacked.jar" "another-jar.jar"]}

Your main clojure application is automatically added in the getdown
config file.

The plugin attach itself to the =lein uberjar= command. Thus,
everytime you uberjar your application, the directory
=/target/getdown/= will be created/updated with the required files to
put on your webserver.
